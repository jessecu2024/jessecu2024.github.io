My research interests have always been anchored in ensuring security and reliability, whether in AI, distributed system and blockchain, or cybersecurity.  I strive to translate technical advancements into real-world applications that enhance everyday life. This commitment not only showcases my depth in technology but also reflects my innovative approach in tackling emerging and complex issues.

The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
