I am a postdoc at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong.  

# ‚ù§Ô∏è **Build Systems We Trust!**

My passion is to build systems that we can trust: systems that are not only technically sound, but also explainable, adaptable, and aligned with human values. 

My work spans  distributed systems/blockchains, AI, and computer networks. I am committed to bridging the gap between technical advancements and real-world applications. I advocate for open-source and reproducible research projects.
