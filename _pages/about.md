I am a postdoc at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong.  

# ❤️ **Build Systems We Trust!**

My passion is to build systems that we can trust: systems that are not only technically sound, but also explainable, adaptable, and aligned with human values. 

My work spans  distributed systems/blockchains, AI, and computer networks. I am committed to bridging the gap between technical advancements and real-world applications. I advocate for open-source and reproducible research projects.

## 🧱 **System Trust: A Three-Layer Framework**

*How do we build systems that truly deserve our trust? Through three progressive levels:*

-Level 1: Existential Trust  -"Can this system work?"
Core Qualities: Secure (Confidential, Integral and Available) · Efficient · Reliable ·  Robust 

-Level 2: Relational Trust  -"Can this system connect and interact?" 
Core Qualities: Explainable · Controllable ·  Predictable · Auditable

-Level 3: Developmental Trust -"Can this system develop and improve?"
Core Qualities: Scalable · Adaptive · Accountable · Evolvable · Ethical · Value-aligned
