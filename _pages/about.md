# Build Systems We Trust.

I am a postdoc at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong.  

‚ù§Ô∏è My passion is to **build systems that we can trust**: systems that are not only secure and reliable, but also understandable, adaptable, and aligned with human values. My work spans  distributed systems/blockchains, AI, and computer networks. I am committed to bridging the gap between technical advancements and real-world applications. I advocate for open-source and reproducible research projects.

 
### üß† System Trust: A Three-Layer Model

I conceptualize system trust in three layers, which guide both my research and design philosophy:

#### ‚úÖ Existential Trust  
_"Can this system work?"_  
‚Üí Secure ¬∑ Reliable ¬∑ Efficient ¬∑ Available ¬∑ Robust ¬∑ Reproducible

#### ü§ù Relational Trust  
_"Can this system connect?"_  
‚Üí Explainable ¬∑ Observable ¬∑ Controllable ¬∑ Interoperable ¬∑ Predictable ¬∑ **Auditable**

#### üå± Developmental Trust  
_"Can this system develop?"_  
‚Üí Adaptive ¬∑ Transparent ¬∑ Ethical ¬∑ Accountable ¬∑ Evolvable ¬∑ Value-aligned

> I design systems that not only function, but connect, evolve, and ultimately earn long-term trust.
