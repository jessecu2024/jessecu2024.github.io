I am a postdoc at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong.  

# ❤️ **Build Systems We Trust!**

My passion is to build systems that we can trust: systems that are not only technically sound, but also explainable, adaptable, and aligned with human values. 

My work spans  distributed systems/blockchains, AI, and computer networks. I am committed to bridging the gap between technical advancements and real-world applications. I advocate for open-source and reproducible research projects.

## 🧱 **System Trust: A Three-Layer Framework**

*How do we build systems that truly deserve our trust? Through three progressive levels:*

**Level 1: Existential Trust** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _-Can this system work?_ 

Core Qualities: Secure · Confidential · Integral · Available · Efficient · Reliable ·  Robust 

**Level 2: Relational Trust** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _-Can this system connect and interact?_  

Core Qualities: Explainable · Controllable ·  Predictable · Auditable

**Level 3: Developmental Trust** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _-Can this system develop and improve?_ 

Core Qualities: Scalable · Adaptive · Accountable · Evolvable ·Sustainable· Ethical · Value-aligned
