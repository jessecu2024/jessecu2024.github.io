I am a postdoc at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong.  

‚ù§Ô∏è My passion has always been to ensure reliability and security across various fields, including distributed systems/blockchains, AI, and computer networks. I am committed to bridging the gap between technical advancements and real-world applications. I advocate for open-source and reproducible research projects.
